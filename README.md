# projectivePlane

Let $X$ be a finite set, and let $L$ be a system of subsets of $X$, the pair $(X,L)$ is called a finite projective plane if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. There exists a 4-element set $F \in X$ such that $|L' \cap F| \leq 2$ holds for each set $L' \in L$.

2. Any two distinct sets $L_1, L_2 \in L$ intersect in exactly one element, i.e., $|L_1 \cap L_2| = 1$.

3. For any two distinct elements $x_1, x_2 \in X$, there exists exactly one set $L' \in L$ such that $x_1 \in L'$ and $x_2 \in L'$.
